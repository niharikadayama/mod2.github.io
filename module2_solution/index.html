                <p>
                     I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I<br>
      I took the one less traveled by,<br>
      And that has made all the difference.<br>

                <p>
                     Come unto these yellow sands,<br>
   And then take hands:<br>
   Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd,<br>
   The wild waves whist<br>
   Foot it featly here and there;<br>
   And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.<br>
